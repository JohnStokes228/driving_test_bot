#Driving Test Bot

contains some untested and thereefore probably poorly funcitoning code to gett he most recetn test date available for
a driving test. Untested because it kept blocking me for using up too much traffic on the website just snooping around the page :(

most likely this code will have to be run like every hour or so at most unless you want to add an ip randomiser or something.

requries chromedriver installed to run.
