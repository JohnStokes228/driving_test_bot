Driving Test Bot

written to try and get sooner driving tests as theres fat queues and what have you ongoing atm.

contains some untested and thereefore probably poorly funcitoning code. Untested because it kept blocking me for using up too much traffic on the website just snooping around the page :( Uses selenium to minimise chances of blocking because of this but still, most likely this code will have to be run like every hour or so at most unless you want to add an ip randomiser or something.

requries chromedriver installed to run due to selenium dependancy.
fill your details in on the config.yaml to set up.
